# Scientific Calculator (Tkinter)

A desktop-based scientific calculator application built using Python's **Tkinter** library for the GUI and the **Math** module for advanced calculations. This project features a responsive interface with support for both basic arithmetic and complex scientific functions.

## ✨ Features
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
- **Trigonometric Functions:** Sin, Cos, Tan, and their hyperbolic counterparts (Sinh, Cosh, Tanh).
- **Logarithmic Functions:** Support for natural log ($ln$), $\log_{10}$, $\log_2$, and $\log_{1+p}$.
- **Mathematical Constants:** Quick access to $\pi$ (Pi), $\tau$ (Tau), and $e$ (Euler's number).
- **Advanced Tools:** Square root, absolute value (PM), and degree/radian conversions.
- **Entry Management:** Clear (C) and All Clear (CE) functionality to reset calculations.
